[LOG 14:56:50]: Nice to meet you!

I'm Gene Kerman, Flight Director and your guide for this quick introduction.

This is the Space Center. From here you can manage all aspects of the Space Program.Feel free to have a look around (Hold the Right Mouse Button to move the camera, or use the [Arrow Keys]).


Right-Click over the Space Center Facilities to view more about them, and Left-Click when you're ready to head inside.
