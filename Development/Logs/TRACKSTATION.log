[LOG 15:02:33]: Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It’s one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint.\n\nIt is considered by some to be almost a sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme press- ures and temperatures. Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are those people?
